# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am proud I did not get frustrated at my little mistakes; such as not putting quotes around what should have been strings. I then read the response in terminal, checked the line is VS and fixed it. 
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Everything in the world repeats, software is not exempt. Creating methods allows programmers to easily repeat tasks over and over again even though the arguments given to the methods change.
